After setting up the development environment, you will implement and work with different WildFly features like implementing Java Server pages, using clustering and load balancing so that your apps can handle a high volume of data traffic. You will work with enterprise Java Beans, solve issues related to failover, implement Java Message Services integration. While building the application, you will also work with Java Naming and Directory Interface, Java Transaction API, and caching. You will use ActiveMQ for message relay and message querying. This book will also show you how you can use your existing backend JavaScript code into your application.

By the end of the book, youâ€™ll have gained the knowledge to implement the latest Wildfly features in your Java applications.
